Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify data — streaming trends, top artists, and user engagement insights.
 Spotify Dashboard using Power BI
 
📌 Project Overview
This project involves designing an interactive Power BI dashboard using Spotify streaming data. The goal is to explore user listening behavior, identify top artists/tracks, and visualize genre-wise streaming trends.
It was created as part of a data visualization learning journey to strengthen skills in data cleaning, modeling, DAX, and storytelling through dashboards.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
Tool	Purpose:
Power BI	                          Data modeling, dashboard creation, DAX
Power Query Editor                 	Data cleaning and transformation
DAX	                                Creating calculated columns, measures

📈 Dashboard Features :

1.Top 10 streamed artists and tracks
2.Monthly and yearly listening trends
3.Genre-wise streaming comparison
4.Interactive filters and slicers
5.Custom KPIs for total streams, unique artists, etc.

🛠️ Procedure Followed :

1.Data Collection & Understanding
  *Import Spotify dataset (CSV or Excel).
  *Explore columns like track, artist, genre, streams, date, etc.

2.Data Cleaning (Power Query)
  *Remove nulls or duplicates.
  *Rename and reformat columns.
  *Parse dates, split genres if needed.

3.Data Modeling
  *Create relationships (if multiple tables).
  *Create date hierarchy for trend analysis.

4.Creating Measures (DAX)
  *Total Streams.
  *Top Artist by Streams.
  *Unique Users or Tracks.

5.Dashboard Building
  *Bar charts, line charts, pie charts.

6.KPIs and slicers
  *Responsive design for interaction.

7.Final Touch
  *Add titles, tooltips, colors.
  *Test filters and visuals for clarity.

📚 What I Learned :
  -> End-to-end Power BI project workflow.
  ->Data transformation in Power Query.
  ->Writing custom measures using DAX.
  ->Using slicers and filters for interactive insights.
  ->Creating clean, informative dashboards.

🚀 Future Improvements :
    *Add time comparison (YoY or MoM growth)
    *Incorporate user demographics (if data available)
    *Embed the dashboard online via Power BI service
    *Automate data refresh using online datasets
